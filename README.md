# DocumentDistance
This is a simple implementation of the Document Distance problem explained in the MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms, Fall 2011 course. For more details see https://youtu.be/Zc54gFhdpLA

## Document distance problem
we have two documents D1 and D2 and we want to compute the distance between them.

### What is distance?
Distance here means finding out whether the documents are similar or not

Document = Sequence of words (string)

Word = Sequence of alphanumeric characters (separated by spaces)

So the idea in this problem is to find the shared words between documents and use that to define distance.
